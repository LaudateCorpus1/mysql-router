# MySQL Router sample configuration
#
# The following is a sample configuration file which shows
# most of the plugins available and most of their options.
#
# The paths used are defaults and should be adapted based
# on how MySQL Router was installed, for example, using the
# CMake option CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
#
# The logging_folder is kept empty so message go to the
# console.
#
# The fabric_cache plugin only works with the MySQL-RPC
# protocol (by default running on port 32275)
#

#[DEFAULT]

#plugin_folder = /usr/local/lib/mysqlrouter

# If no plugin is configured which starts a service, keepalive
# will make sure MySQL Router will not immediately exit. It is
# safe to remove once Router is configured.
